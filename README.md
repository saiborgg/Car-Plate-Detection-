This project implements a Car Plate Detection system using Deep Learning. The dataset consists of car images (.png) and their corresponding bounding box annotations (.xml). Images are preprocessed by resizing and normalizing, while bounding box coordinates are scaled accordingly. A MobileNetV2 backbone with custom dense layers is used to regress bounding box coordinates for license plates. The model is trained and fine-tuned on the dataset, achieving reasonable performance in predicting plate locations. The notebook covers the full pipeline: data loading, preprocessing, train-test splitting, model building, training with validation, evaluation (loss & MAE), and visualization of predictions, making it a complete end-to-end object detection project.
